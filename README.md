Medilink — Smart Hospital Appointment Booking System

This repository contains a full-stack MVP for Medilink: a hospital appointment booking system.

- `/backend` — Node.js + Express API using SQLite and JWT auth
- `/frontend` — Minimal React app (Vite) that consumes backend APIs
- `/docs` — Week-by-week reports and notes (week-1.md .. week-9.md)
- `/tests` — simple smoke tests to exercise the API

Weekly breakdown is available in `/docs`. The project was developed across 9 weekly milestones; each week has a short report and the artifacts produced that week.

See `/backend/README.md` and `/frontend/README.md` for run instructions.
