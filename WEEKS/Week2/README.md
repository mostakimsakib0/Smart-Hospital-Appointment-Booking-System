# Week 2 — I/O and Screens

Summary of Week 2 deliverables and where to find them in the repo.

Backend (Md. Mostakim Ahmed Sakib)
- List of backend modules (I/O notes): see `backend/package.json` and `backend/index.js` (endpoints).
- I/O details are implicit in the routes. For example: `POST /auth/login` expects `{email,password}` and returns `{token}` on success.

Frontend (Md. Saiful Islam)
- List of frontend screens: `frontend/src/App.js` defines routes (Dashboard, Login, Register, Appointment).
- Wireframe notes (if present): `frontend/WEEK2_FRONTEND_SCREENS_WIREFRAMES.md` (check this markdown for sketches/notes).
