# Week 4 — Routing, Auth, Login/Register

Week 4 deliverables and where to find them.

Backend (Md. Mostakim Ahmed Sakib)
- Routing and controllers: `backend/index.js` (routes for auth, doctors, appointments)
- Authentication helpers: `backend/auth.js` (JWT sign/verify)
- Login/Register APIs: `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login` (implemented in `backend/index.js`)

Frontend (Md. Saiful Islam)
- Login / Register pages that POST to the backend: `frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.js`, `frontend/src/pages/RegisterPage.js`
- Forms wired to endpoints via fetch calls.
