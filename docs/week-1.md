# Week 1 — Repo setup (Backend: Md. Mostakim Ahmed Sakib, Frontend: Md. Saiful Islam)

Deliverables:
- Scaffolded repository with `/backend` and `/frontend` folders.
- Root `README.md`, `.gitignore` and devcontainer placeholder.
- Backend: Express server, Sequelize models (User, Doctor, Appointment), seed data, auth routes (register/login).
- Frontend: Vite + React app with Home, Register, Login, Doctors pages and booking form.

How to run (local): see root `README.md` and per-folder READMEs.
