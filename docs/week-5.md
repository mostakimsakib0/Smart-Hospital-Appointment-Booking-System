# Week 5 — Sample data & UI integration

Backend:
- Seed script added to create a sample patient (`patient@example.com` / `password123`) and several doctors (see `/backend/src/seed.js`).
- Verified endpoints return expected JSON structures.

Frontend:
- Homepage and Navbar added, doctor listing displays seeded doctors, booking form posts to `/api/appointments`.
