# Week 4 — Routing & Authentication

Backend:
- Implemented routes and controllers for auth, doctors, appointments.
- JWT-based authentication with middleware (`/backend/src/middleware/auth.js`).
- Register and Login endpoints created and tested locally with seed user.

Frontend:
- Built Login/Register pages and wire them to backend endpoints (simple flows implemented in `/frontend/src/pages`).
