# Week 7 — Testing & Integration

Planned and added simple test scripts to exercise APIs. Use the `tests/smoke` scripts (bash) to perform health checks, register/login, list doctors, book/update/delete appointments.

You can run the tests after starting the servers:

```bash
cd tests/smoke
./run-all.sh
```

The scripts use `curl` and are intentionally simple so instructors can follow easily.
