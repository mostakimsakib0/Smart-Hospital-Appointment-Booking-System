# Backend — Week 1

This backend is a minimal Node.js/Express app created to satisfy Week 1 tasks for Md. Mostakim Ahmed Sakib.

Completed tasks:
- Repo setup
- Install packages & DB (Express + sqlite3)
- Hello-world API

Run locally:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The API exposes a GET / endpoint that returns a Hello World message.
